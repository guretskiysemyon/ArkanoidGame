# ArkanoidGame

## Context of the project::
This project was completed as part of the course "Introduction to Object Oriented Programming" using the Java programming language. 
The primary goal of this project was to learn key concepts in OOP, coding principles, design patterns, file hierarchy, and packages.
The project consists of four levels of an Arkanoid Game, which will be discussed in the following sections.

## Install:
I wrote this project in the IntelliJ IDEA IDK (JetBrains production), so if you use it too you can clone this repository and run the project.
Otherwise, create Java project in your IDK. You have the source files in the src folder of this repository, so you can use it and put in src
of you project. The "biuoop-1.4.jar" file was given to me by university and this is lybrary for work with GUI, so you need to add this as lybrary
in you project. Try to run it.

## About the game
You have 4 level in this game.
